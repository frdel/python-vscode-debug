Minimal Python VSCode debugging and typechecking setup

This demo project contains the minimal configuration files and recommended extensions to have typechecking and debugging support for your python application in VS Code.

The "Debug main.py" launch configuration will run main.py file in debugger no matter what file you have currently open. I find this more convenient when working with projects that have a single launch script.
